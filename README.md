# DATS6401: Complex Visualization Project 2

## Objective
While the development of new technologies has increased in the last century, so too has the rate of scientific publications and research. The past several years has seen an explosive increase in the rate of scientific publishing from 1% and 2% in the 19th and 20th centuries respectively, to nearly 10% this decade (Bornmann, 2014). While the printing press led to the emergence and growth of print scientific journals in past centuries, today digital publishing occurs on platforms such as Figshare, Dryad and Zenodo (Hannay, 2014). This project seeks to visually show the growth and other key aspects of digital publishing platforms.

## Assumptions and Questions
What can we tell about academia and the research world through the mining of publication data? Have topics studied stayed the same over the past two decades and have the places where that research takes place and how it is presented shifted as well? This visualization project will study this.

## Tools Used
The project is presented in the form of an interactive HTML page using CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, D3.js, Leaflet, DataTable and other applicable visualization libraries. It also leveraged a custom Jupyter notebook with Python, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and the Requests library for retrieval and processing and use Zenodo's open access Open Archives Initiative (AOI) XML interface for retrieving structured metadata about publications. Source code management and hosting leveraged GitHub.
